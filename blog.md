# Getting Things Started
Date: Monday, October 17th-26th, 2022

- Found our supervisor and had our first meeting.
- Made our proposal for our project.
- Had our second meeting and got our proposal reviewed by our supervisor.
- Set up the repository and added the proposal to it.
- After supervisor accepted proposal, order was placed for Raspberry Pi and associated sensors.

At the start of our project, we spent a lot of time researching potential ideas and identifying a problem that we wanted to solve. We wanted to create a project that was impactful, practical, and could make a difference in people's lives.
After several brainstorming sessions and discussions, we identified environmental monitoring as an area that we wanted to focus on. We were inspired by the idea of using technology to address environmental issues and contribute to sustainability efforts.
After conducting extensive research and gathering feedback, we developed a proposal for our project and submitted it to our supervisor for review. This proposal outlined our vision, goals, and objectives for the project, as well as our plan for implementation and development.
Once our proposal was accepted, we set up a repository and began working on the development of our web application. We spent a lot of time in the initial stages of development setting up our infrastructure, testing our sensors, and drafting scripts to gather and send data.
Overall, the beginning stages of our project were focused on research, planning, and laying the foundation for our web application. This involved a lot of groundwork, but it was essential in ensuring that we had a solid foundation to build upon as we moved forward with the project.

# Presentation Slides
Date: November 1st-11th, 2022

- Made an ethics form and submitted it.
- Ethics form approved.
- Made a google slides presentation for our project.
- Presented it to Panel consisting of John McKenna and Paul Clarke.
- Project got accepted

# Proof of Concept
Date: November 4th-10th, 2022
- After sensors arrived we began test them.
- Initial brief testing for proof of concept was conducted.
- Decided to use python for sensor data collection program as sensors had python library support.
- Python script was drafted to gather data and send to another device as JSON file. 

# Data Collection
Date: November 17th-24th, 2022
- Script to gather all data complete.
- Script to bundle the data into JSON and send to another device (future server) complete.
- Proof of basic concept complete.
- Next item we do will be writing up Functional Specification.

# Functional Specification
Date: December, 3rd, 2022

Finalised and submitted our functional specification.

# December Update
We both decided that majority of December would be spent doing research.
<br>
This was due to exams being in this month, as time was mostly spent on studying and preparation for exams.
<br>
The holiday period being directly after exams also contributed to the decision.
<br>
Spare time would be dedicated for research.

# Results of Research
After the in depth research period, we came to the conclusion of:
- Using Javascript due to NodeJS and ExpressJS being intercompatible.
- Bootstrap was decided for the Frontend styling as it's popular open source and we have some experience using it. 
- By using NodeJS we have access to powerful NPM libraries, improving development time.
- Chance to use Javascript which we touched upon during CA318.
- We can gain experience building a Webapp outside of Django.
- EJS would be used as it is much more similar to HTML than other templating engines such as PUG.

# Progress Update
Date: January, 10th-15th, 2023

- Added install.sh to repository.
- Added config.cfg to repository.
- Added app.js to repository.
- Added start.py to repository.
- Added html and ejs files to repository.

# Progress Update
Date: January 15th-26th, 2023

- Created backend server.
- Manged to display sensor data on graphs on the website.
- Had a meeting with our supervisor to check progress.
- Added bootstrap to index.html.
- Added email notifications.

As we moved into the new year, our focus shifted to improving the functionality and user experience of our web application. We began by adding an install.sh file to our repository, which simplified the installation process for users. We also added a config.cfg file, which contained configuration variables for our application.
We continued to work on our server.js file, which served as the backbone of our backend server. With this file, we were able to display sensor data on graphs on the website, and we also added email notifications to alert users when certain thresholds were exceeded.
In our meeting with our supervisor, we discussed our progress and received feedback on our work thus far. We continued to make improvements, including adding bootstrap to our index.html file for improved styling, and creating an admin dashboard for managing sensor nodes and notifications.

# Progress Update
Date: February, 1st-10th, 2023

- Split charts and added background colour for visibility.
- Unit testing of JavaScript.
- Bug fixes.
- Added admin dashboard.
- Refactored start.py.
- Added sensor node and notification deletion by admins.

#Progress Update
Date: February, 11th-23rd, 2023

- Finalizing graphs and admin for adding sensors.
- Get realistic DANGER figures for each sensor.
- Added an about page.
- Added css to Homepage, sensor data page, login and register page, about page and admin-register page.
- Made Technical manual.
- Made User manual.
- Made video walkthrough.

As we moved into February, we focused on unit testing our JavaScript code, fixing bugs, and refactoring our start.py file. We also added the ability for admins to delete notifications and to add sensors to the system. We researched and obtained realistic danger figures for each sensor to better inform users of potential hazards.
To improve the user experience of our web application, we added an about page and applied CSS styling to various pages. We also created a technical manual, a user manual, and a video walkthrough to help users understand how to use our application.
Overall, our work during these months was focused on building a functional and user-friendly web application, while also gathering and implementing feedback from our supervisor.
