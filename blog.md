# Proof of Concept

- After sensors arrived we began test them.
- Initial brief testing for proof of concept was conducted.

- Python script was drafted to gather data and send to another device as JSON file. 

# Data Collection
Date: November 17th-24th, 2022
- Script to gather all data complete.
- Script to bundle the data into JSON and send to another device (future server) complete.
- Proof of basic concept complete.
- Next item we do will be writing up Functional Specification.

# Functional Specification
Date: December, 3rd, 2022

Finalised and submitted our functional specification.

# December Update
We both decided that majority of December would be spent doing research.
<br>
This was due to exams being in this month, as time was mostly spent on studying and preparation for exams.
<br>
The holiday period being directly after exams also contributed to the decision.
<br>
Spare time would be dedicated for research.

# Results of Research
After the in depth research period, we came to the conclusion of:
- Using Javascript due to NodeJS and ExpressJS being intercompatible.
- Bootstrap was decided for the Frontend styling as it's popular open source and we have some experience using it. 
- By using NodeJS we have access to powerful NPM libraries, improving development time.
- Chance to use Javascript which we touched upon during CA318.
- We can gain experience building a Webapp outside of Django.
- EJS would be used as it is much more similar to HTML than other templating engines such as PUG.
