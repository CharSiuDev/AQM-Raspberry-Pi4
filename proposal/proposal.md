Description: 
This indoor air quality monitoring project will be based off of a Raspberry Pi with an Enviro + Air Quality Addon and a PMS5003 PM Sensor. This project will ideally have the scalability to accommodate the hundreds of lecture rooms DCU has. 
This idea came to mind as lecture rooms may get extremely humid depending on many factors such as the amount of people in the room or ventilation and currently there isnâ€™t a publicly accessible way for students and lecturers to find out the room conditions. Through this we wish to provide an economical solution to that problem.
The data will be collected by the sensors and sent by the raspberry pi towards a server which hosts the website. Ideally it will be similar to the opentimetable.dcu.ie website where you search for the location and lecture room and shows you the data it has collected. 
The data will be graphed and will allow a refresh function to grab the latest information. Ideally we will implement a top down view for the DCU Campus with building floors filtered by layers in order to improve the ease of use.

Division of Work:
Ronghui Lin: Sourcing required hardware, implementing sensors + raspberry pi, sending data to server, implementing frontend.
Vaidas Buzas: Backend, creating the server and database management.

Learning Challenges: 
Data retrieval
Hardware and Software Integration
Data Visualization
Learning the react framework
Learning nginx web server
Learn about networking - transferring data across networks.
Utilising libraries from sensors.
Hardware / software platform:
PC, Raspberry Pi OS.
Special hardware / software requirements:
For this project, it will be using a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B 8GB as it is the current one we have on hand
An alternative and much more economical 15 euro Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W would suffice for our requirements, however manufacturer lead times stretch into July 2023.
In order to get air quality data, an Enviro + Air Quality add-on chip for Raspberry Pi is required to monitor various environmental data. 
A PMS5003 Particulate Matter Sensor is also required in order to monitor Particular Matter (PM) levels in the room.
